title: "Multilingual Scraper of Privacy Policies and Terms of Service"
abstract: "We developed a scraper for privacy policies and terms of service, designed for long-term data collection over a multiple-year period. This scraper supports 37 languages, addressing the systematic understudy of non-English websites. We crawl nearly 1 million websites monthly, sampled from various countries and popularity ranks using the Chrome UX Report list, which closely represents real user behavior and reduces sampling bias. This project provides an unprecedented dataset for empirical research in privacy policies and terms of service, enabling comprehensive studies of legal documents across different languages and regions."

# Multilingual Scraper of Privacy Policies and Terms of Service

**Authors: Karel Kubicek <karel.kubicek@inf.ethz.ch>, David Bernhard, Stefan Bechtold**

**Abstract:** *Websites' privacy policies and terms of service constitute valuable resources for scholars in various disciplines. Nonetheless, there exists no large, multilingual database collecting these documents over the long term. Therefore, researchers spend a lot of valuable time collecting them for individual projects, and these heterogeneous methods impede the reproducibility and comparability of research findings. As a solution, we introduce a long-term scraper of privacy policies and terms supporting 37 languages. We run our scraper on a monthly basis on 800'000 websites, and we publish the dataset for the twelve crawls in 2024. Our manual evaluation of the end-to-end extraction of the documents demonstrates F1 scores of 79% for privacy policies and 75% for terms of service in five sample languages (English, German, French, Italian, and Croatian). We present several broad potential applications of our database for future research.*

### Change log, outages, and outliers

*Please not that first months of 2024 were still subject to modifications, while we were reaching final deployment stage. From May 2024, the crawler is stable and such changes should be rare.*

* 2024-01 crawl: 556'281 websites using a different sampling: top 30k websites from each country
  - Crawl period: 2023-12-27 - 2024-01-16
  - Document detection using search engine (startpage.com) resulted in many documents from PayPal that are linked on each result page. We exclude these manually.
* 2024-02 crawl: 800'151 websites, with 6k websites per bucket
  - Crawl period: 2024-01-27 - 2024-02-23
  - StartPage search dropped to about 15% of previous month due to bot detection.
* 2024-03 crawl: 854'044 websites, with 6k websites per bucket
  - Crawl period: 2024-03-02 - 2024-03-21
  - StartPage search back to normal, removal of PayPal from search results - this holds for future crawls as well.
* 2024-04 crawl: 802'174 websites, we reduced the sampling to 5k websites per bucket - from this point is the sampling process stable, see documentation in the paper
  - Crawl period: 2024-04-02 - 2024-03-20
* 2024-05 crawl
  - From this crawl on, we use classification of policies and terms. Older crawls do not check the documents by the content, but only order available links to documents according to matching. We will retrospectively compute probabilities that collected documents were indeed policy/terms for older crawls.
  - Crawler correctly processes HTTP errors (e.g., 404 Page not found) and excludes them from detected documents. Also, documents shorter than 60 characters are ignored.
  - The new strict interpretation of policies and terms reduced detection rates. We however still store also documents that are plausibly policy or terms (with ML classification accompanied).
* 2024-07 crawl
  - We deployed the crawl on a new server dedicated to the project for a long term.
