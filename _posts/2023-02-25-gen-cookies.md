# Automated Large-Scale Analysis of Cookie Notice Compliance

**Authors: Ahmed Bouhoula, Karel Kubicek, Amit Zac, Carlos Cotrini, and David Basin**

**Abstract:** *Privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) require websites to inform EU-based users about non-essential data collection and to request their consent to this practice. Previous studies have documented widespread violations of these regulations. However, these studies provide a limited view of the general compliance picture: they are either restricted to a subset of notice types, detect only simple violations using prescribed patterns, or analyze notices manually. Thus, they are restricted both in their scope and in their ability to analyze violations at scale.*

*We present the first general, automated, large-scale analysis of cookie notice compliance. Our method interacts with cookie notices, e.g., by navigating through their settings. It observes declared processing purposes and available consent options using Natural Language Processing and compares them to the actual use of cookies. By virtue of the generality and scale of our analysis, we correct for the selection bias present in previous studies focusing on specific Consent Management Platforms (CMP). We also provide a more general view of the overall compliance picture using a set of 97k websites popular in the EU. We report, in particular, that 65.4% of websites offering a cookie rejection option likely collect user data despite explicit negative consent.*

### Motivation

The EU tried to address ubiquitous tracking on websites by regulations, namely with the ePrivacy Directive and GDPR. Therefore are websites now asking for consent with these practices, often framed as "cookie consent." As numerous prior studies, including our own [CookieBlock](https://karelkubicek.github.io/post/cookieblock), showed, these notices fail the task to inform users and even more in giving users choices.
 <!-- This creates a false expectation of compliance while also harming web usability. -->

These past studies are however significantly constrained, giving us biased measurements. Either they depend on specific technologies present in a subset of consent notice or they are manual and therefore cannot scale. Our work addresses these constraints by a crawler that interact with the notices and machine learning that classifies declared and observed practices of websites.

### Crawler interacting with notices

The past automated studies relied on the API used by specific cookie notices. We created a crawler that detects notices using a heuristic based on 1) a crowd-sourced [EasyList Cookie](https://secure.fanboy.co.nz/fanboy-cookiemonster.txt), 2) [z-index](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index) of the notice, and 3) filtering based on spaCy library. Then it does not stop at the notice front page, but it navigates the notice as a graph using DFS, observing what interaction is available. This allows us to perceive the notices as users do, not as the API specifies them.

We then browse the website after different interactions with the notice: rejecting or accepting the cookies, saving default settings, dismissing the notice with a close button, or not interacting at all.

Using machine translation and multilingual models, we support websites in the following languages: Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Spanish, and Swedish.

### ML and NLP models

Crawler extracts the declared behavior by the notice (its text and interaction choices), as well as the observed behavior (cookies that were used by the website depending on our notice interaction). We reason about the collected data using three ML models.

* We predict the declared data collection purposes in the notice text using a BERT model. We trained this model using the dataset by [Santos et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02597), where we reduced labels to binary decision whether the sentence declares data processing purpose that requires users' consent. This included the following purposes: profiling, advertising, custom content, analytics, and social media features. This model reaches 97.6% accuracy.
* We predict the purpose of interactive elements of the cookie notice using a BERT model trained on a dataset of 2353 interactive elements annotated in notices by us. The labels are accept, reject, close, save, settings, and other. This model achieves 95.1% accuracy.
* We classify whether the website uses cookies that require consent using an XGBoost model. This model is based on our prior [CookieBlock](https://karelkubicek.github.io/post/cookieblock) work, but it operates over all cookies of website, allowing us to classify when website uses such cookies with a precision of 98.67% and a recall of 91.82%.


### Violation detection

We select 97k websites for crawling using Chrome UX report. This list generalizes the real browsing patterns the best ([Ruth et al.](https://doi.org/10.1145/3517745.3561444)). Selecting EU (+UK) countries that speak one of the supported languages ensures that the websites target users under GDPR.

The crawled data allows us to reason about differences between declared and observed behavior. The outputs of ML models are parameters for or decision tree, which outputs ten privacy violations or dark patterns.

*Decision tree that takes as input the classifications by our model and outputs all types of potential violations present on the website.*

*On the left, the decision tree of dark patterns. On the right, observed statistics of potential violations and dark patterns.*

### Selected results of specific populations

We can parametrize website selection based on the country, popularity rank, and the consent notice technology the website uses. We list the most important observations, all of them are statistically significant:

* Popular websites have fewer **visible violations** such as missing notice, missing reject button, or undeclared purposes than less popular websites. Yet when it comes to how they **track users** the situation is the opposite. Popular websites ignore rejected consent, assume consent before user interacts with the notice, or assume consent after user uses "close button" more often than less popular websites.
* Sampling bias of prior studies, stemming from reliance on specific consent notice technologies, makes the majority of observed results vastly different from Chrome UX report sample. Specifically, websites using [Transparency & Consent Framework](https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/) studied by [Matte et al.](https://doi.org/10.1109/SP40000.2020.00076) are far more violating consent.

*On the left, we present violations per rank from the Chrome UX report. On the right, we compare our results with other studies and investigate whether their website selection caused any bias.*



### Q&A

* **Q:** How can I access the study results or code?

  **A:** Since our work depends on ML, it can produce false positives. To reduce the impact of false reporting of individual websites violating regulations, we restrict access upon request. Please fill [this form](https://forms.gle/4cPPLnkwA241sKbP6) to get access.

* **Q:** What is the probability that your violation decision tree produces false positives?

  **A:** We tuned the models to be conservative, so they rather produce false negatives. Our evaluation on 500 random websites quntifies both false positives and negatives, showing that our results are conservative. For more details, check Section 7 of the paper.
